# System-Administration
Documentation created for a university course on the topic of system administration.

Topics covered:
* Installing an operating system (manually resizing partitions etc.)
* Setting up a firewall (nftables)
* Network Configuration
* Setting up a DNS Server (Bind9)
* Setting up a DHCP Server
* Setting up a database (PostgreSQL)
* Setting up a web server (Nginx & Apache)
* Hosting an open source web service (Nextcloud)
* Setting up a file server (NFS, SMB, Autofs)
* Setting up an LDAP server 
* Setting up a mail server (Postfix)
* Setting up a network monitoring service (Prometheus & Grafana)
* Doing security scans (Nmap, OpenVAS, Rootkit Hunter)

We worked in teams of two. The repository my partner and I used internally is also pinned on my profile. I created this one, which contains only the documentation, to provide a clean overview.
