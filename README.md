# System-Administration
Documentation created for a practical university course on the topic of system administration.

Topics covered:
* Installing an operating system (manually resizing partitions etc.)
* Setting up a firewall (nftables)
* Network Configuration
* Setting up a DNS Server (Bind9)
* Setting up a DHCP Server
* Setting up a database (PostgreSQL)
* Setting up a web server (Nginx & Apache)
* Hosting an open source web service (Nextcloud)
* Setting up a file server (NFS, SMB, Autofs)
* Setting up an LDAP server 
* Setting up a mail server (Postfix)
* Setting up a network monitoring service (Prometheus & Grafana)
* Doing security scans (Nmap, OpenVAS, Rootkit Hunter)

We worked in teams of two. Each week of the semester, we got an assigment and had to research, implement and document the described service. The repository my partner and I used internally is also pinned on my profile. I created this repository, which contains only the documentation, to provide a clean overview.
