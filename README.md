# System-Administration
Documentation created for a practical university course on the topic of system administration.

Topics covered:
* Installing an operating system (manually resizing partitions etc.)
* Setting up a firewall (nftables)
* Network configuration
* Setting up a DNS server (Bind9)
* Setting up a DHCP server
* Setting up a database (PostgreSQL)
* Setting up a web server (Nginx & Apache)
* Hosting an open source web service (Nextcloud)
* Setting up a file server (NFS, SMB, Autofs)
* Setting up an LDAP server 
* Setting up a mail server (Postfix)
* Setting up a network monitoring service (Prometheus & Grafana)
* Doing security scans (Nmap, OpenVAS, Rootkit Hunter)

We worked in teams of two. Each week of the semester, we got an assigment and had to implement and document a solution. The course involved very little teaching, pretty much everything we did is based on our own research.
